        <p>I'm in this course because I've been interested in web design since I first started programming. I wasn't there during the days MySpace was popular, but eventually I tried editing HTML code on Tumblr themes. Later on, as websites started looking sleeker, I became interested in creating something similar for fun.</p>
        <p>HTML and CSS seemed easy enough to pick up, however I didn't have the discipline to learn everything I needed to learn to create and host a website on my own.</p>
        <p>So, in this class, I'm hoping to learn:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>HTML and CSS</li>
            <li>Making a responsive website</li>
            <li>Hosting a website</li>
        </ol>
