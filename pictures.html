                <h3>Lights Festival</h3>

                <p>I've been wanting to go to the lights festival since I first saw the images of people releasing the lanterns into the night sky. I'm hoping I could go to one this year.</p>

                <p>For the longest time, I've heard that Six Flags is where to go for good rides. I finally got to go last year and the rides had my heart pounding.</p>
